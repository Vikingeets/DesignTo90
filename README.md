# DesignTo90

This mod allows you to plan or paste a complete dyson sphere, even if you haven't yet researched the technology to increase the latitude limit. Instead, the limit will apply during the actual construction.

## Features

- The latitiude limit will be ignored when planning or pasting.
- Rockets will not be sent towards nodes that are outside the limit.
- Sails will not fill shells unless all of that shell's nodes are buildable.
- Upgrading the latitude limit will automatically resume construction of dyson spheres, up to the new limit.
